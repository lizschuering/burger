# What Does the App Do?

* Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger in the 'Burgers to Eat' column on the left side of the page -- waiting to be eaten.

* When the user clicks the button next to the burger they want to eat, the burger will be "eaten" and moved to the column 'Burgers I've Eaten' on the right side of the page.

# How was the App Made?

The app follows the model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern. 

The front-end was created with HTML, CSS, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and Javascript.

The back-end was created using MySQL, Node, Express and Handlebars and requires the following NPM packages:

* [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql)
* [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
* [Express-Handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars)
* [Body Parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser)
